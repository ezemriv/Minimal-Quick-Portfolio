  With a PhD and a strong background in cancer research, I have transitioned into the field of data science, driven by a passion for uncovering hidden patterns and solving problems. Leveraging over 5 years of experience in data cleaning, statistical analysis, and extracting actionable insights, I am now focusing on expanding my knowledge in machine learning.

  Proficient in R and Python, I am dedicated to applying my skills to drive impactful data-driven decisions. I am particularly interested in applying my expertise in the healthcare or sustainable sectors.
