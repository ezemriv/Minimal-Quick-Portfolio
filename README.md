# Build Your Portfolio with Jekyll: A Quick Guide

This repository offers a streamlined template for building a professional portfolio using Jekyll and deploying it seamlessly on GitHub Pages. Whether the goal is to showcase recent projects or enhance job-seeking efforts, this guide provides the necessary tools to create a polished online presence without requiring extensive coding expertise.

**Note:** This repository originated as a forked template from evanca/quick-portfolio, which has been adapted for a more mobile-friendly experience and to allow better project categorization. Projects have been organized into "Research Projects" and "Personal Projects" to distinguish academic and personal work.

## How It Works

1. **Fork the Template**: Visit GitHub and fork this repository. Rename the forked repository to `username.github.io` (replace `username` with your actual GitHub username).
2. **Deploy with GitHub Pages**: In the repository settings, activate GitHub Pages to transform the Jekyll project into a live website.
3. **Personalize Your Portfolio**: Customize the portfolio by uploading a logo and project images. Edit the sidebar (`_config.yml`) to add personal details such as name, contact information, and links to social profiles.
4. **Showcase Your Projects**: Modify the `index.md` file to highlight key projects. Each project can include descriptions and links to its source code, whether hosted on GitHub, GitHub Pages, or custom portfolio pages.
5. **Fine-Tuning (Optional)**: For further customization, modify the HTML layout, set up a custom domain, or update repository files like `LICENSE` and `README.md` for a personalized touch.

This process enables the creation of a professional portfolio on GitHub Pages without requiring deep knowledge of HTML or Jekyll. The focus remains on showcasing skills and accomplishments, while the template handles the technical setup.
