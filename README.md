### Ezequiel Rivero's Data Science and ML Portfolio

Welcome to my data science portfolio! Here, you'll find a collection of projects showcasing my expertise in data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning. 

The portfolio features:

* **PhD & Postdoctoral Research:** In-depth projects exploring cancer datasets and my own experiment's data.
* **Personal Projects:**  Applications of data science to my personal interests.

This portfolio is built using a Jekyll theme [1], which I've heavily customized and optimized for a better mobile experience.
